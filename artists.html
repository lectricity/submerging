</p>
<p id="description">
Ashley Teamer returned home to New Orleans in 2013, where she was immersed in a performative and artistic community. In summer 2014 Ashley was accepted into Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. There, she began questioning her traditional painting practice and took her first step into video and performance. Inspired by this exploration Ashley created the persona, Drifter a mysterious and passionate man found in bars across New Orleans. In summer 2015 she attend ACRE residency in Wisconsin. An experiment with stop-motion animation inspired her to begin blurring the lines between painted and digital images.

<p id="description">
"My work is a manifestation of black female liberation. In these images I transform WNBA players into super heroes searching outer space for a new home that recognizes their greatness, skill, and perseverance. These women finally able to liberate themselves from the hierarchies of Earth embracing their future while destroying their past. I view the restricted consciousness of my African-American existence through this landscape. Narratives by John Akomfrah and Octavia Butler have inspired me to create a world shaped by black excellence, freedom, and a carefree people through painting. I use time as a dimension in my work to expand the scope of the image. Transforming physical rectangles into portals to my alternate reality."

<p id="description">
eduardo restrepo was born in Hospital San Juan de Dios in Armenia, Quindio. eduardo was raised between the ages of 0 to 14 by mother - Adriana Castaño - as well as grandparents, aunts, and friends in the municipalities of Circasia and Quimbaya, moving with mom and sister on an average of two houses per year. At age 14 it was decided to bring eduardo and sister - Sofia Restrepo - to West Palm Beach, Florida, where father - Jhon Jaime Restrepo - had been residing for a year at apartment complex Tennis Towers. Three years later eduardo, now age 17, and Sofia, now age 19, moved further South to Tamarac, Florida to live with Sofia's boyfriend - Manuel Ruiz - whose house had a pool. While in Tamarac, eduardo assisted Broward College and began to make deliberate images with encouragement of professor and artist Teresa Diehl. After going to a portfolio review with several art education institutions, eduardo realized the opportunity to move North and took that chance ending up in Boston's School of the Museum of Fine Arts, which is located about 45 minutes away by bike from Mystic Lake. Recently, after living and working in Boston for four years, eduardo relocated to Bedford Stuyvesant in hopes to continue living and working deliberately.

<p id="title"><b><a href="http://cargocollective.com/GabbahBaya/About-1">Gabbah Baya</a></b>
</p>
<p id="description">
Born in 1994 and raised in West Palm Beach Florida, Gabbah Baya has a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Her upbringing as an Arab American in the United States informs her art through creating alternative narratives and immersive digital environments. As an interdisciplinary worker - using sound, video, and 3D animation - Gabbah Baya develops a world where multifaceted, sometimes contradictory, realities exist simultaneously. Drawing on issues of intersectionality, she forms hyperreal spaces to address gender, race, and international politics. Deconstructing hegemonic symbols, Gabbah Baya recontextualizes them in the visual vernacular of video games into new spatial, visual, and sonic realities. These realities ultimately critique U.S. perception of the Middle East, using technology to reassert agency and subvert narratives of social and political power.

<p id="title"><b><a href="http://isabelaaliciabaptista.fr">Isabel Alicia Baptista Gomez</a> </b>
</p>
<p id="description"> Isabel Alicia Baptista makes directories. Finding partnerships between research and the literary to the visual. By applying abstraction, Isabel Alicia creates intense personal moments created by means of rules and omissions, acceptance and refusal, pulling the viewer into varying social spaces. Her paintings while produced through the artist’s studio, reference found text and known works to then produce "translated" works. As if someone were to tell a joke, but omit the punchline from not having understood it themselves. The results are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. Presently by investigating the English, French and Spanish language, the folklore of Paris and colonial Connecticut, she absorbs the tradition of remembrance and journalism into abstracted paintings and texts to be read to a public.
