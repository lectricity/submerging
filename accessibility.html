<h1>Submerging Accessibility Information</h1>

<p>41 Cooper Sq has 3 elevators which go from the first floor to LL1, where the gallery is located. The entrance is on the northwest corner of the building. There is a revolving door and two large swinging doors. The doors may be open, and can be pulled open. The guard at the front desk can open the doors with a button, knock or send someone in to get their attention. There is a button on the outside which does not normally work.</p>

<p>The floor is polished concrete with some smooth unevenness. The stairs leading down to LL1 are improperly spaced at approximately one and one half steps. The stairs are smooth with a strip of friction tape at the end of each stair. There are degendered bathrooms on both the first floor and LL1. There is one ADA acessible bathroom on the first floor, and 2 on LL1. Seats will be available during performances and readings. Seats can be requested from the gallery watchers during gallery hours. The building is cooled through a central air system. It often feels cold during the summer. While we suggest that visitors avoid wearing scents, this is not a scent free zone. The gallery watcher's phone number will be left at the guard's desk to deal with issues with guards.</p>

<p>There is construction surrounding 41 Cooper Sq. The crosswalk to the west of the building is unpaved currently and rough with poorly maintained ramps to the lowered roads. </p>
