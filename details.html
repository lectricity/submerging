<h1>Submerging</h1>

<p><i>Submerging</i> is fundraising for F2L, a New York City based project. F2L works to support queer and trans people of color in New York State whose lives are impacted by the prison-industrial complex. F2L is a volunteer run project primarily made up of queer and trans people of color in NYC that provides jail, court, media and housing aid to individuals targeted by the prison system, as well as to the communities who are supporting their cases.</p>

<p>
The United States incarcerates more of its population than any other country on earth—this cycle of incarceration specifically affects Black people, Indigenous people, and communities of color. Within those communities we see disproportionate rates of incarceration for LGBTQGNCTSI people, people living with HIV/AIDS, and people with disabilities. Nearly 8 percent of all individuals in state and federal prisons identify as LGBTQ, and 1 out of 5 trans women will spend some portion of their lives locked up.<sup>1</sup> A recent report by Black & Pink found that 85% of its LGBTQ respondents have been in solitary confinement and approximately half have spent 2 or more years there.<sup>2</sup> People of color were twice as likely to be put in solitary confinement. In addition, respondents were 6 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than the general prison population. 
</p>

<p>
These statistics are only a glimpse into the daily lived violence faced by queer and trans communities of color. F2L’s goal is to directly support impacted individuals while envisioning an end to police and prison violence through fundraising, advocacy and organizing. Both Submerging and F2L are entirely volunteer run projects—every dollar raised during this exhibition goes directly into F2L’s current advocacy work.
